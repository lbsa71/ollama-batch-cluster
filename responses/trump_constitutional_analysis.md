### ðŸ“š Historical Context: The Rise of Autocracy in Russia

Three decades ago, on August 19, 1991, Russians stood firm against a coup that threatened their fragile democracy. Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin played pivotal roles in navigating the Soviet Union through reforms, yet their decisions laid groundwork for future autocracy. Yeltsin's choice of Vladimir Putin as successor set Russia on a trajectory towards authoritarianism. This historical precedent offers insights into how Trump could mirror Putinâ€™s consolidation of power.

### Constitutional Amendments and Legal Frameworks

Putin's rise involved rewriting Russia's constitution to extend his rule indefinitely. Similarly, Trump's Project 2025 aims to consolidate executive power, blurring lines between the White House and judiciary. By bypassing judicial constraints, Trump risks a constitutional crisis, akin to Putinâ€™s gradual dismantling of democratic checks.

### Control of Key Institutions

Putin seized control of Russia's judiciary, media, and security agencies. Trump has shown intent to influence federal judges, with 139 legal challenges filed against his administration. By packing the judiciary with loyalists, Trump could centralize power, mirroring Putinâ€™s suppression of dissent.

### Media and Information Control

State-controlled media in Russia propagates pro-Putin narratives. Trump's use of social media to bypass traditional outlets echoes this strategy. By controlling narrative flow, he shapes public perception, fostering loyalty while discrediting criticsâ€”a tactic reminiscent of Russian propaganda.

### Economic Leverage

Putin leveraged state control over energy and banking to consolidate power. Trump could exploit economic policies, targeting opponents financially. This economic influence complements political moves, solidifying his grip on both state and economy.

### Political Party Consolidation

Putin's United Russia party dominates politics. Trumpâ€™s hold over the Republican Party mirrors this, with loyalty tests ensuring party alignment. This consolidation stifles internal dissent, creating a loyalist base crucial for maintaining power.

    "content": "Analyze how Donald Trump could potentially consolidate power in 2025 by examining [Putin's constitutional changes](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-constitution-idUSKBN20D2J5) and [historical precedents](https://www.britannica.com/topic/authoritarianism). Focus on constitutional mechanisms rather than violence or force. Consider:\n\n1. Constitutional amendments and legal frameworks\n2. Control of key institutions\n3. Media and information control\n4. Economic leverage\n5. Political party consolidation\n\nUse specific examples from both Russian and historical contexts to illustrate each point. Maintain an analytical, non-partisan tone."
